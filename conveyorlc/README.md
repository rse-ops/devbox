# conveyorlc

This is an attempt to create a base environment and we need.
Nix just has one version, so we have to use that.

- openmpi
- boost@1.72 (with mpi bindings)
- conduit@0.8.4 +hdf5
- openbabel@3.0.0 ~python ~gui

Note that we are just missing conduit (@vsoch is going to make a nix package).
